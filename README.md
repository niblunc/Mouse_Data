## About The Data
In the attached file there is one header row identifying the wire number from FP01 to FP31, and one index column of time.  There are 31 columns of data, so this is 10 minutes of data sampled at 1KHz.  Wires 1-16 are OFC, and 17-31 are DMS.  (We lose channel 32 in our recording system so there are only 15 in DMS).  I am sending a period of data where the mouse was resting but unfortunately the stimulation is still going every 5 seconds.  So you're likely to pick up on that correlation (hopefully!).
