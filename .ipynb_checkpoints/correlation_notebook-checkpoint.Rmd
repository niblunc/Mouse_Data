This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
mouse_data = read.csv("346_OFCDMSrecording_10min_For_Kyle.csv")
head(mouse_data, 6)
```
Now we compute correlation matrix with standard pearson, in this table correlations coefficients b/w possible pairs of variance are shown

```{r}
mouse_data.cor = cor(mouse_data)
round(mouse_data.cor, 2) # round to 2 decimal places

#cor(mouse_data, use = "complete.obs") # fill in missing data
```
Here using the function "rcorr()" to compute the significant levels of pearson and spearman correlations. It returns both correlation coefficients and the p-value for all possible pairs of columns
```{r}
#install.packages("Hmisc")
library("Hmisc")
matrix_2 <- rcorr(as.matrix(mouse_data))
# The output is a list containing 
matrix_2

```

The output of the function rcorr() is a list containing the following elements : - r : the correlation matrix - n : the matrix of the number of observations used in analyzing each pair of variables - P : the p-values corresponding to the significance levels of correlations.

```{r}
matrix_2$r # extract correlation coefficients
matrix_2$P # extract p-values
```
```{r}
flattenCorrMatrix <- function(cormat, pmat) {
  ut <- upper.tri(cormat)
  data.frame(
    row = rownames(cormat)[row(cormat)[ut]],
    column = rownames(cormat)[col(cormat)[ut]],
    cor  =(cormat)[ut],
    p = pmat[ut]
    )
}

matrix_2 <- rcorr(as.matrix(mouse_data[, 1:7]))
flattenCorrMatrix(matrix_2$r, matrix_2$P)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
